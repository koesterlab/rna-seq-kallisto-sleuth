Differentially expressed transcripts using the model ``{{ snakemake.params.model["full"] }}``, computed with sleuth. The columns ``b_*`` and ``b_*_se`` display the effect size :math:`\beta` and the corresponding standard error for every covariate in the model. They are analog to log2 fold changes. Note that non-binary covariates are binarized by sleuth, leading to multiple columns ``b_*1``, ``b_*2``, etc.
